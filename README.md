# Temp-Tables

This C program will print out temperatures of four different units
(Kelvin, Fahrenheit, Celcius, and Reaumur) using a user defined base unit,
lower limit, upper limit, and step, while also appending a border
line to ease reading through the printout.

## Disclaimer

This program does NOT and will NOT guarantee super precise results.
Although it will give you *accurate enough* results.
This is caused by the inherent 'imprecision' in computers.

## Building from source

You can build from source using `GCC` or any other C compilers using
`gcc -x c -o filename[.exe] filename.c`

Feel free to edit the file to your needs.
